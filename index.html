<p>Rick and Morty is one of the highest-rated tv shows on IMDB today. It has a devoted base of disciples that would make Game of Thrones fans seem cheap. Owing to the ongoing trend, McDonald’s even carried out their old Szechuan sauce for one day, though at a few locations only, to celebrate this hilarious show. Since the time of its release, Rick and Morty has established a huge fan base consisting of stoners. </p>



<p>And why not, the spooky nature of its each episode served along with perfectly timed comedy does the trick on millions. The fictional world is loaded with insane drugs that aren&#8217;t even practical. Be it Moloko drug from A Clockwork Orange or HFS intoxicant, fictional drugs always look tacky and cool in a casual and fun way. But nobody is even closer to the inconceivable universe of drugs in Rick and Morty. </p>



<p>Now from like ages ago, weed lovers have picked up their favorite things to pair with getting stoned, so as to make their experience more fun and unique. As bong is probably the most advertised form of taking cannabis, it follows the trend by having characters like Rick and Morty, which are widely crazed by weed consumers. </p>



<p>Even cartoons of our childhood like <em>Scooby Doo </em>have catered to the stoner views, so it&#8217;s entirely possible that this bizarre yet cool culture became forever engraved in our world. As a matter of fact, you can find rolling kits, marijuana vape pens, and even cannabis bongs, describing the character as cool and self-righteous.  </p>

<h2><span id="What_Is_Rick_and_Morty_Spice_Grinder">What Is Rick and Morty Spice Grinder?</span></h2>



<p>Rick and Morty is basically a cartoon series that is based on a family who is visited by their grandpa Rick to avail of some help. Seeing that, Rick&#8217;s daughter Beth, welcomes him with open arms and so the story of the weird scientific discoveries and adventures starts to shape. The series mainly revolves around the grandfather and son team Rick and Morty as they make their journey through bizarre multiverses and bring unbelievably quirky discoveries along the way, mostly in an attempt to avoid impending death. </p>



<p>But people mostly fall in love with the unique comedic aspect of Rick and Morty as the patriarch male character has been brought frequently in its episodes and taken from other such series like American Dad. But usually, people cannot comprehend how it endorses the cannabis culture, catering to a huge audience of stoners since marijuana has never been shown or talked about in the show.  </p>



<h2><span id="Why_Rick_and_Morty_Are_So_Often_Associated_With_Marijuana_Use">Why Rick and Morty Are So Often Associated With Marijuana Use?</span></h2>



<p>We know that there is no actual relation of cannabis in Rick and Morty, then why does the world have a huge selling number of cool <em>Rick and Morty</em> bongs. If you want to know that, you have to look at the show with a keener eye and then you&#8217;ll realize the number of spooky drugs that are consumed and even endorsed in Rick and Morty. </p>



<p>To name a few, Mega Seeds, Kalaxian Crystals, Alien Pheromones, Worm Hole Tripping, and Rick Potion #9, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. There has never been a show so much into drugs as Rick and Morty. And watching many of these drugs reminds the weed smokers of the classic trip of getting high on cannabis for the first couple of times.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="619" height="413" src="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5850" srcset="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-4.png 619w, https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-4-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></figure></div>



<p>And if you can&#8217;t relate it being a non-consumer of weed, you can enjoy the funny after-effects of the characters using those drugs and doing stupid things like dancing and singing and a huge amount of laughing that&#8217;s related to the typical buzz phase. So those who do not take any kinds of drugs can simply take it as a hilarious and entertaining show of watching someone get high and committing the stupidest things.</p>



<p>If you already possess a <em>Rick and Morty</em> bong, then this is all just old news for you, but if you are among those who are yet untouched by this unique culture and have always been seeing the fictional characters on bongs in your local shops with confusion and curiosity, now you know why they are where they are. </p>



<p>Every cartoon character that you&#8217;ll come across on marijuana paraphernalia is there because it&#8217;s somehow, even remotely, related to the usage of drugs. After all, humans have always looked and searched for a state of mind that&#8217;s enjoyable and a little higher than normal, and this has been in the civilization for ages, just modifying as the era changes.  </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="618" height="415" src="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5846" srcset="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png 618w, https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></figure></div>



<p>Rick and Morty is a sitcom for adults that spans a total of four seasons and has overall 41 episodes. Apart from comedy which is the main selling point of this show, you can find some good irony, pop-culture reminiscence, as well as cynicism. </p>



<p>It even stretches to gentle nihilism at times and can make the audience uncomfortable with some dark episodes. But these are the very attributes that make people go crazy over Rick and Morty. The key is in the balance as the show balances all these genres almost flawlessly. So in a nutshell, it is worth watching.</p>



<p>You can see some fabulous voice acting here, despite Rick&#8217;s constant burping habit. And the hint of sci-fi makes the show appeal to the tech and science geeks. Moreover, the introduction of aliens, multiverses, and cross-dimension travel packed up in a quirky but bone-tickling story make Rick and Morty one of the most popular shows in today&#8217;s times. So this is a show worth watching and it is up to the audience how they take the show, laugh it out or begin some serious ban movement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><span id="Some_Insane_Drugs_from_Rick_and_Morty">Some Insane Drugs from Rick and Morty</span></h2>



<h3><span id="1_Kalaxian_Crystals_K-lax">1) Kalaxian Crystals (K-lax)</span></h3>



<p>Klaxian Crystals have been shown as a dangerous high quality drug that&#8217;s quite abundant. Aberdolph Lincler even died attempting to get them, but Rick didn&#8217;t care as he desperately wanted the Klaxian Crystals. Although it did not give him a good trip, we see Rick’s eyes turn turquoise, and he simultaneously makes up a song and dances to it. </p>



<p>But Klaxian Crystals do not have a long-lasting effect, and before their true nature can be discovered, Morty takes them away and dumps them to end Rick&#8217;s party.</p>



<h3><span id="2_Perspective_Enhancing_Alien_Pheramones">2) Perspective Enhancing Alien Pheramones</span></h3>



<p>There wasn&#8217;t much talk about the Perspective Enhancing Alien Pheramones (PEAP), but anybody can gather that they are to be taken using a laser hooka and they have an uncanny resemblance to weed. They are said to be very powerful in the show, but sadly the creators did not show any character consuming them and what happens to them afterward. Rick brings these pheramones as a result of a feud between him and the U.S.A. President. </p>



<p>So he gathers diplomats from Israel and Palestine to a Star Wars cantina, and they consume Rick&#8217;s drugs and end up signing the Kind of Obvious if You Think About It Accords, bringing the conflict to closure. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="585" height="603" src="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5847" srcset="https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1.png 585w, https://weedbonn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></figure></div>



<h3><span id="3_Mega_Seeds">3) Mega Seeds</span></h3>



<p>Mega Seeds have raised questions worth debating among the show&#8217;s dedicated fanbase, and these debates are kinda never-ending. We see in the first episode itself, Rick telling Morty that he needs these seeds for some kind of research but then that is it. Because of this vague description, the Rick and Morty fans have been debating each other. </p>



<p>They even came up with fan theories suggesting that the smartness and intelligence Rick has is because of his abstinence from alcohol and instead, he takes Mega Seeds in the form of juice every day. Well, we&#8217;ll keep debating on that one, but what we can gather about Mega Seeds is that if inserted rectally, they will give a sort of superintelligence until the dose is all consumed. </p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean this drug doesn&#8217;t have a con; Mega Seeds take about 72 hours to wash down the effects and produce agonizing pain in the consumer&#8217;s body, creating a complete loss of consciousness for that time.  </p>



<h3><span id="4_Rick_Potion_No_9">4) Rick Potion No. 9</span></h3>



<p>This drug seems like the safest option in the whole Rick and Morty series as Rick made it himself. But even Rick Potion No.9 doesn&#8217;t come without its side effects like morty pickle. And man, are they terrible! Rick made it so that his grandson could be fancied by his crush. But because his crush was suffering from a cold at the time she consumed these drugs, the effects spread throughout the school and onto the whole world. </p>



<p>And it gets worse; as Rick tries to undo this disaster, he ends up transforming all the people into detesting creatures called Cronenberg monsters. </p>



<h3><span id="5_Worm_Hole_Tripping">5) Worm Hole Tripping</span></h3>



<p>This is my favorite one. When Rick passes across a wormhole, accompanied by Jerry and a murderous alien on a spaceship that is without protection; they get into a group psychedelic experience, with their consciousnesses fusing with each other and with time at the same instant.  The trip they get is kinda like a salvia trip, although weirder. </p>



<p>Except for Rick, this crazy adventure seemed to change everyone for a time. Rick even goes out to state and point out the fact that cosmic apotheosis fades away faster than salvia. So in the end, he kills the alien with a bullet in his face. </p>

It has a devoted base of disciples that would make Game of Thrones fans seem cheap. Owing to the ongoing trend, McDonald\u2019s even carried out their old Szechuan sauce for one day, though at a few locations only, to celebrate this hilarious show. Since the time of its release, Rick and Morty has established a huge fan base consisting of stoners. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And why not, the spooky nature of its each episode served along with perfectly timed comedy does the trick on millions. The fictional world is loaded with insane drugs that aren't even practical. Be it Moloko drug from A Clockwork Orange or HFS intoxicant, fictional drugs always look tacky and cool in a casual and fun way. But nobody is even closer to the inconceivable universe of drugs in Rick and Morty.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now from like ages ago, weed lovers have picked up their favorite things to pair with getting stoned, so as to make their experience more fun and unique. As bong is probably the most advertised form of taking cannabis, it follows the trend by having characters like Rick and Morty, which are widely crazed by weed consumers. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even cartoons of our childhood like <em>Scooby Doo <\/em>have catered to the stoner views, so it's entirely possible that this bizarre yet cool culture became forever engraved in our world. As a matter of fact, you can find rolling kits, marijuana vape pens, and even cannabis bongs, describing the character as cool and self-righteous.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":5848,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/weedbonn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5848\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What Is Rick and Morty Spice Grinder?<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rick and Morty is basically a cartoon series that is based on a family who is visited by their grandpa Rick to avail of some help. Seeing that, Rick's daughter Beth, welcomes him with open arms and so the story of the weird scientific discoveries and adventures starts to shape. The series mainly revolves around the grandfather and son team Rick and Morty as they make their journey through bizarre multiverses and bring unbelievably quirky discoveries along the way, mostly in an attempt to avoid impending death. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But people mostly fall in love with the unique comedic aspect of Rick and Morty as the patriarch male character has been brought frequently in its episodes and taken from other such series like American Dad. But usually, people cannot comprehend how it endorses the cannabis culture, catering to a huge audience of stoners since marijuana has never been shown or talked about in the show.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why Rick and Morty Are So Often Associated With Marijuana Use?<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We know that there is no actual relation of cannabis in Rick and Morty, then why does the world have a huge selling number of cool <em>Rick and Morty<\/em> bongs. If you want to know that, you have to look at the show with a keener eye and then you'll realize the number of spooky drugs that are consumed and even endorsed in Rick and Morty. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To name a few, Mega Seeds, Kalaxian Crystals, Alien Pheromones, Worm Hole Tripping, and Rick Potion #9, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. There has never been a show so much into drugs as Rick and Morty. And watching many of these drugs reminds the weed smokers of the classic trip of getting high on cannabis for the first couple of times.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":5850,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/weedbonn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5850\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you can't relate it being a non-consumer of weed, you can enjoy the funny after-effects of the characters using those drugs and doing stupid things like dancing and singing and a huge amount of laughing that's related to the typical buzz phase. So those who do not take any kinds of drugs can simply take it as a hilarious and entertaining show of watching someone get high and committing the stupidest things.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you already possess a <em>Rick and Morty<\/em> bong, then this is all just old news for you, but if you are among those who are yet untouched by this unique culture and have always been seeing the fictional characters on bongs in your local shops with confusion and curiosity, now you know why they are where they are. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every cartoon character that you'll come across on marijuana paraphernalia is there because it's somehow, even remotely, related to the usage of drugs. After all, humans have always looked and searched for a state of mind that's enjoyable and a little higher than normal, and this has been in the civilization for ages, just modifying as the era changes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>What To Expect From Rick and Morty( No Spoilers)<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":5846,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/weedbonn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5846\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rick and Morty is a sitcom for adults that spans a total of four seasons and has overall 41 episodes. Apart from comedy which is the main selling point of this show, you can find some good irony, pop-culture reminiscence, as well as cynicism. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It even stretches to gentle nihilism at times and can make the audience uncomfortable with some dark episodes. But these are the very attributes that make people go crazy over Rick and Morty. The key is in the balance as the show balances all these genres almost flawlessly. So in a nutshell, it is worth watching.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can see some fabulous voice acting here, despite Rick's constant burping habit. And the hint of sci-fi makes the show appeal to the tech and science geeks. Moreover, the introduction of aliens, multiverses, and cross-dimension travel packed up in a quirky but bone-tickling story make Rick and Morty one of the most popular shows in today's times. So this is a show worth watching and it is up to the audience how they take the show, laugh it out or begin some serious ban movement.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Some Insane Drugs from Rick and Morty<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>1) Kalaxian Crystals (K-lax)<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Klaxian Crystals have been shown as a dangerous high quality drug that's quite abundant. Aberdolph Lincler even died attempting to get them, but Rick didn't care as he desperately wanted the Klaxian Crystals. Although it did not give him a good trip, we see Rick\u2019s eyes turn turquoise, and he simultaneously makes up a song and dances to it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But Klaxian Crystals do not have a long-lasting effect, and before their true nature can be discovered, Morty takes them away and dumps them to end Rick's party.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2) Perspective Enhancing Alien Pheramones<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There wasn't much talk about the Perspective Enhancing Alien Pheramones (PEAP), but anybody can gather that they are to be taken using a laser hooka and they have an uncanny resemblance to weed. They are said to be very powerful in the show, but sadly the creators did not show any character consuming them and what happens to them afterward.\u00a0Rick brings these pheramones as a result of a feud between him and the U.S.A. President. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So he gathers diplomats from Israel and Palestine to a Star Wars cantina, and they consume Rick's drugs and end up signing the Kind of Obvious if You Think About It Accords, bringing the conflict to closure.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":5847,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/weedbonn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5847\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3) Mega Seeds<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mega Seeds have raised questions worth debating among the show's dedicated fanbase, and these debates are kinda never-ending. We see in the first episode itself, Rick telling Morty that he needs these seeds for some kind of research but then that is it. Because of this vague description, the Rick and Morty fans have been debating each other. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They even came up with fan theories suggesting that the smartness and intelligence Rick has is because of his abstinence from alcohol and instead, he takes Mega Seeds in the form of juice every day.\u00a0Well, we'll keep debating on that one, but what we can gather about Mega Seeds is that if inserted rectally, they will give a sort of superintelligence until the dose is all consumed. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But that doesn't mean this drug doesn't have a con; Mega Seeds take about 72 hours to wash down the effects and produce agonizing pain in the consumer's body, creating a complete loss of consciousness for that time.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4) Rick Potion No. 9<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This drug seems like the safest option in the whole Rick and Morty series as Rick made it himself. But even Rick Potion No.9 doesn't come without its side effects like morty pickle. And man, are they terrible! Rick made it so that his grandson could be fancied by his crush. But because his crush was suffering from a cold at the time she consumed these drugs, the effects spread throughout the school and onto the whole world. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And it gets worse; as Rick tries to undo this disaster, he ends up transforming all the people into detesting creatures called Cronenberg monsters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>5) Worm Hole Tripping<\/h3>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is my favorite one. When Rick passes across a wormhole, accompanied by Jerry and a murderous alien on a spaceship that is without protection; they get into a group psychedelic experience, with their consciousnesses fusing with each other and with time at the same instant.\u00a0\u00a0The trip they get is kinda like a salvia trip, although weirder. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Except for Rick, this crazy adventure seemed to change everyone for a time. Rick even goes out to state and point out the fact that cosmic apotheosis fades away faster than salvia. So in the end, he kills the alien with a bullet in his face.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/herb-platform-images.imgix.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/24232818\/rickandmorty_ep305_005_Wormhole_Tripping.jpg?auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=react-8.6.4&amp;w=688\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Rick and Morty Smoking Weed Episodes To Watch Stoned<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now every stoner has a list of things they want to do while getting stoned, and binge-watching is on the list most of the time.
